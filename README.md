# Realtime Voting System
## Overview
This is a Real-Time Voting System project that uses Apache Spark Streaming, Kafka, and Streamlit to process and display voting data in real time. 

The application allows users to cast votes and see live updates of results, showcasing the power of big data streaming and visualization.

The project is based on a tutorial from a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-JnC9daQxE&list=PL_Ct8Cox2p8WjETeFftZePYTvuTRDx5h-&index=6) channel [CodeWithYu](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithYu).

## Features
Real-time voting data processing: Votes are processed as they are cast, using Apache Spark and Kafka.

Live visualization: Streamlit is used to display real-time voting statistics.

Scalable architecture: Designed to handle large-scale voting data.

## Technologies Used
  *Apache Spark Streaming*: To process streaming data in real time.
  
  *Kafka*: As a message broker for streaming votes.
  
  *Streamlit*: For building an interactive dashboard to visualize results.
  
  *Python*: For the application logic and data processing.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial [Realtime Voting System | End-to-End Data Engineering Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-JnC9daQxE&list=PL_Ct8Cox2p8WjETeFftZePYTvuTRDx5h-&index=6). 

It helped me learn the fundamentals of real-time streaming and build this application.
